Employee Data Analysis and Retention Insights
This project involves analyzing employee data to uncover insights into workforce demographics, retention trends, and attrition factors. By leveraging SQL, we perform data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and detailed employee retention and attrition analysis.

Dataset Overview
The dataset contains information about employees, including:

Education Level
Joining Year
City of Employment
Payment Tier
Age
Gender
Whether Ever Benched
Experience in Current Domain
Attrition (Leave or Not)

Key Steps in the Project
1. Data Cleaning
Removed duplicates and checked for missing values to ensure data quality.
Created a cleaned dataset using SQL queries.

2. Descriptive Analytics
Employee Demographics: Gender distribution, average age, education levels, and city-wise distribution.
Workforce Metrics: Average tenure, payment tier distribution, and analysis of employees ever benched.

3. Employee Retention Analysis
Insights into retained employees by analyzing their demographics, experience, education, and city-wise distribution.

4.Attrition Analysis
Explored factors contributing to employee attrition, including education levels, payment tiers, age, and tenure.
Calculated overall and group-specific attrition rates to identify trends.

Tools and Technologies
SQL: Data cleaning, aggregation, and analysis.

Results and Insights
The attrition rate provides insights into workforce stability.
Factors such as education, payment tiers, and tenure significantly influence retention and attrition.
Gender and city-wise analysis highlight potential areas for improving employee satisfaction and reducing churn.

Future Work
Integrate visualization tools like Tableau or Python libraries for richer insights.
Explore predictive modeling to identify employees at risk of attrition.
